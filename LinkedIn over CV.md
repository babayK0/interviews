# Linkedin vs CV

## LinkedIn

LinkedIn is a professional social network that is used for sourcing in software engineering world nowadays.
There you can fill up some fancy information about yourself - your experience, how long you are in the industry, what you are looking for, where did you study.

## CV

CV is some document that briefly describes who you are, what you did, where did you study and so. You won't believe me, but in LinkedIn you can expose this information as well and let people apply search filters on your profile as well such as "give me everyone who studied in Boston in 2014-2018".

So, what is the process? You are looking for a job: actively (surfing through the internet, applying at company's website or so) or passively (just waiting for offers to appear). If you are doing the first way, then you will face the problem that most of the companies want to get your CV in the first place when you are applying for a job.

Why would they need that? They want to know stuff about you to be sure whether you could potentially be a candidate for them or not - is there any sense in inviting you for an interview. Also, this document helps a lot people who are going to interview you because they can see what you are familiar with, what you are proficient with, what you are passionate about and so. This really helps to prepare the right questions for you. However, not all the interviewers do that and that's bad though.

Only if there was a opportunity of sending them like a personal website with your CV in fancy HTML/CSS/JS... Oh wait, you actually should be allowed to do that because they are interested in the information, not in the fact that you have CV. And you can send your LinkedIn profile link which is actually your CV - it has all the information needed for recruiter/sourcer.

## Why should you prefer one over another'?'

Because there is no point to have these two things at the same time.

And by having an up-to-date LinkedIn profile you allow people to see who you are, what you did and so without having to directly contact you and waste theirs and yours time.
LinkedIn is the way of having an opportunity to say to someone at hiring event "just find me on LinkedIn, my name is John Doe" and that would be enough!

However, a lot of recruiters blindly follow the processes they have and don't even think what they get from this CV - an information about the candidate. So why can't you get this information from his LinkedIn, huh?
Your recruiting processes and algorithms should help you, but not go against you.

## How your LinkedIn should look like'?'

There is no magic or rocket science involved, it should just have all the required information: who you are, what you do, where did you study, what experience do you have, what skills do you have, what you are looking for, what are you passionate about, which projects you've delivered in the past.

And that's it, just enough - make yourself a good LinkedIn profile and this effort will pay back anyways. Don't send CV, use the professional network.
